# pi-goal Architecture

This document describes the shipped `pi-goal` extension as it exists now. It focuses on implemented behavior.

## Runtime shape

`extensions/goal.ts` is a thin installer (under 50 lines). It registers the two
custom message renderers, builds the shared `GoalCore` (goal-state.ts), and
registers the command palette, the tool surface, and the lifecycle event
handlers from their dedicated modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `goal.ts` | Thin installer: renderers + module registration only |
| `goal-state.ts` | `GoalCore`: all mutable state (pool, focus, audit/UI flags), `GoalService`/`GoalRuntime`/`GoalAccounting` wiring, persistence and reconciliation closures, widget status |
| `goal-tools.ts` | Registration composition only: a 14-line installer that wires `registerCoreTools` + `registerTaskTools` |
| `goal-core-tools.ts` | `create_goal` / `get_goal` / `update_goal` executors plus the blocked flow |
| `goal-completion.ts` | The completion transaction: `runGoalCompletionFlow` (audit orchestration) + shared `commitGoalCompletion` |
| `goal-task-tools.ts` | `set_goal_tasks` / `update_goal_task` executors plus flat parent-linked conversion, id-stable merge, `countTasks` |
| `goal-task-review.ts` | Per-task code review gate: git review baselines, task-scoped changed files and diff, classification, skip rules, and the reviewer call with its `task_review` ledger outcome |
| `goal-task-confirmation.ts` | Task-only result boundary (`{decision}`, no auditor toggle) with neutral Confirm task list / Keep current tasks labels |
| `goal-commands.ts` | The curated fourteen-command palette and its handlers |
| `goal-events.ts` | Lifecycle and provider event handlers (`context`, `before_provider_request`, `turn_start`, `tool_call`, `tool_execution_end`, `turn_end`, `message_end`, `session_start`, `session_before_compact`, `session_compact`, `session_tree`, `before_agent_start`, `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, `session_shutdown`) |
| `goal-widget.ts` | Terminal input keybindings (Esc pause / abort-audit, Ctrl+Shift+T overlay) and the hidden debug helpers |
| `goal-format.ts` | Pure formatting/message-introspection helpers and renderers |
| `goal-service.ts` | `GoalService` — the sole mutation boundary: ordered reconcile → id/focus-revision validation → clone-mutate → write/archive → ledger → memory commit → returned effects |
| `goal-runtime.ts` | `GoalRuntime` — continuation scheduling, stale checkpoint state, turn-stop guard, one-shot steering reminders |
| `goal-accounting.ts` | `GoalAccounting` — serialized idempotent token/time accounting, budget helpers |
| `goal-record.ts` | Goal record types, creation, cloning, usage normalization, persisted-record migration |
| `goal-pool.ts` | Open-goal pool helpers, focus resolution, list output, selector labels, unfocused summaries |
| `goal-core.ts` | Compact display formatting, status labels, objective title cleanup |
| `goal-contract.ts` | Record/input parser: verification-contract extraction and objective prompt-safety |
| `goal-policy.ts` | Lifecycle policy and validation (completion/blocked/resume/task gates), task-tree helpers, compaction policy, result reports |
| `goal-auditor.ts` | Independent pi auditor agent prompt/config/decision parsing and completion audit execution |
| `goal-ledger.ts` | Single-file goal ledger append/read/reconstruction (18 event types incl. `task_reopened`) |
| `goal-draft.ts` | Drafting prompt/confirmation text helpers (goalDraftingPrompt, buildDraftConfirmationText, renderConfirmationTasks, GoalDraftingFocus) |
| `goal-drafting.ts` | Guided drafting orchestration: durable `pi-goal-draft` session entries (survive compaction/tree navigation), resume/replace/cancel protection, transient drafting profile, `goal_question`/`goal_questionnaire`/`propose_goal_draft` tools, per-draft auditor selection |
| `goal-questionnaire.ts` | Structured question/answer UI (`runGoalQuestionnaire`, `showProposalDialog`) used by the drafting tools and confirmations |
| `goal-tool-names.ts` | The five published tool-name constants, lifecycle-dependent profiles, work/progress classification, post-stop allowlist |
| `goal-detail.ts` | Lossless objective/task/history paging with content-bound cursors |
| `goal-ledger-index.ts` | Incremental per-goal activity, audit, lifecycle, and Oracle projections |
| `goal-task-index.ts` | Content-keyed task snapshots shared by prompts, tools, and dashboard models |
| `prompts/goal-prompts.ts` | Bounded five-tool steering prompts (active-goal, continuation, stale-checkpoint, unfocused, budget-limited) |
| `storage/goal-files.ts` | Goal path safety, serialization/parsing, active-file scanning, active-file writes, archive writes, prompt-body merge from disk |
| `widgets/goal-widget.ts` | Above-editor Goal Beacon component |
| `widgets/goal-notifications.ts` | Widget-style notification text for goal lifecycle toasts |

The runtime is a focused-goal view over a project goal pool:

```ts
let goalsById: Map<string, GoalRecord>;
let focusedGoalId: string | null;
```

`goalsById` is reconstructed from `.pi/goals/active_goal_*.md` plus compatible
legacy session entries. `focusedGoalId` is reconstructed from branch-local
`pi-goal-focus` session entries. The focused id is not serialized into goal
markdown.

## Sole mutation boundary

`GoalService` owns the ordered mutation pipeline. Every goal-file write,
archive, and ledger append routes through it:

```text
reconcile (disk wins over stale memory)
  → expected-id / focus-revision validation (async operations invalidated on focus change)
  → mutate a clone (never the live object)
  → write or archive the active file
  → append ledger events (best-effort; failure emits a warning diagnostic)
  → commit to memory + focus
  → return effects (ok, goal, focusChanged, messages)
```

If the write fails, nothing commits and nothing is appended. If the ledger
append fails after a successful write, the transition still stands and the
failure is surfaced through the `onDiagnostic` hook (an observable
`severity: warning, source: ledger` diagnostic) without rolling back the
authoritative state write. Handlers keep validation and
runtime/UI effects; they never touch storage directly. `goal.ts` has zero
direct write or ledger calls.

## Lifecycle

```text
/user command or explicit create_goal request
  ├─ /goal [seed] or /sisyphus [seed]
  │    └─ guided draft: clarify/questionnaire → objective + optional task proposal → explicit confirmation
  ├─ /goal-direct <objective> or /sisyphus-direct <objective>
  │    └─ direct creation: objective (1–4000 chars) → active goal file → focused → autoContinue
  ├─ focused active goal
  │    ├─ autoContinue queues checkpoint turns
  │    ├─ update_goal({status:"blocked"}) records a distinct blocked state after the same
  │    │   blocker recurs on three consecutive turns
  │    └─ update_goal({status:"complete"}) starts the independent auditor; <approved/> archives
  ├─ paused/blocked goal
  │    ├─ /goal-resume restarts autoContinue
  │    └─ update_goal(complete) can complete from existing evidence
  ├─ multiple open goals
  │    ├─ /goal-list shows the project goal pool
  │    ├─ /goal-focus chooses the session focus
  │    ├─ /goal-unfocus clears only the session focus and leaves the shared goal open
  │    └─ unfocused sessions guide the user to choose instead of letting the agent decide
  └─ /goal-clear archives the focused goal after confirmation (cancel is a durable no-op)
```

## Goal pool and session focus

The disk layout supports multiple active files. The extension treats those
files as the durable project-level open goal pool:

```text
.pi/goals/active_goal_<timestamp>_<id>.md
```

`readActiveGoalPool(ctx)` scans that directory, ignores invalid files and
symlinks, parses each safe active file, sanitizes metadata paths, drops
completed records, and returns a deterministic `Map<goalId, GoalRecord>`.

Session focus is separate. Focus changes append a custom session entry:

```ts
{
  version: 1,
  focusedGoalId: string | null,
  reason: "created" | "selected" | "unfocused" | "resumed" | "completed" | "cleared" | "migrated"
}
```

Because this is stored with `pi.appendEntry("pi-goal-focus", ...)`, it is
session/branch-local and is not sent to the LLM. On `session_start` and
`session_tree`, `loadState(ctx)` scans `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` for the
latest focus entry, scans active goal files, and resolves focus as follows:

1. Use a valid focused id from the latest focus entry.
2. If the latest focus entry explicitly has `focusedGoalId: null`, or points at
   a missing/stale goal, remain unfocused.
3. If no focus entry exists, merge a compatible legacy `pi-goal-state { version: 3, goal }`
   goal and focus it. If disk already has the same id, the disk record wins and
   the legacy session record only supplies focus.
4. If no focus entry exists and `autoSelectSingleGoal` is enabled, auto-focus
   the sole open goal for compatibility. The default is disabled.
5. Otherwise remain unfocused until the user explicitly selects a goal.
   `/goal-unfocus` appends a null focus entry so the current session stays
   detached without modifying the shared goal or appending a project-global
   focus event.

Focus is human-owned. No agent tool can switch focus. Lifecycle tools operate
only on the focused goal.

## Goal styles

### Regular goal

Regular goals are open-ended objectives. The agent decides the next concrete
action each checkpoint turn, then completes only after the objective is
actually satisfied.

### Sisyphus goal

Sisyphus is a light variant of the same goal lifecycle. It does not have a
separate execution state machine or step counter. The only differences are
prompt/criteria level:

- the objective is written as numbered ordered steps with per-step done criteria;
- continuations remind the agent not to rush, skip, or invent preflight steps;
- completion still uses `update_goal(status="complete")`, with the stricter
  expectation that the whole ordered objective is actually satisfied.

## Creation and tweaking

`/goal [seed]` and `/sisyphus [seed]` begin guided drafting. The temporary
draft profile exposes only question/questionnaire/proposal tools. The agent
clarifies intent, proposes the full objective and an optional task tree, and
the user explicitly confirms or continues refining. `/goal-direct` and
`/sisyphus-direct` bypass this only when the objective is already final.

`/goal-tweak <change>` starts the same guided-confirmation process for the
focused goal. It preserves the task list when no replacement is proposed and
records `goal_tweaked` (plus `task_list_set` if applicable) only after the
user confirms.

## Command focus behavior

- `/goal [seed]` starts a regular guided draft; bare `/goal` asks what to accomplish.
- `/sisyphus [seed]` starts a Sisyphus guided draft.
- `/goal-direct <objective>` and `/sisyphus-direct <objective>` create directly without drafting.
- `/goal-list` prints all open goals with id, status, mode, usage, objective title, path, and a focus marker.
- `/goal-status health` performs a read-only coherence check for focus, lifecycle, goal-file presence, malformed ledger entries, task progress, and token-budget pressure; it never acts as a completion verdict.
- `/goal-focus` uses `ctx.ui.select` when multiple goals are open and updates only session focus.
- `/goal-unfocus` writes a null session focus entry, clears continuation/runtime state, aborts in-flight work and audits for that session, and leaves the shared active goal file and project-global focus ledger unchanged. Focus revision tokens prevent pending completion and task-list results from mutating a goal after detachment.
- `/goal-resume` resumes the focused paused goal; when unfocused with multiple open goals, it asks the user to choose. Choosing an already active goal only focuses it.
- `/goal-clear` asks for confirmation (with the goal's one-line summary) and archives only the focused/selected goal; cancelling is a byte-for-byte no-op with no file, focus, or ledger change, and headless runs return guidance without mutating anything.
- `/goal-pause` pauses the focused active goal; it asks the user to choose when unfocused with open goals.
- `/goal-settings` renders and dispatches every persisted field from one declarative row table: booleans (`disableTasks`, `disableContracts`, `autoSelectSingleGoal`, `disabled`) toggle directly, `provider`/`model` edit and clear, `thinkingLevel` accepts every level and rejects unknown values, and `subtaskDepth` validates the full input string (whole positive safe integers).

## Tool surface

The extension registers five normal-execution tools and three drafting-only tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `create_goal` | Create and focus a new goal after an explicit user request (objective 1–4000 chars, optional `mode` regular/sisyphus and `token_budget`). |
| `get_goal` | Compact summary by default; lossless objective/tasks/history pages (up to 4,000 content characters), optional task selection, legacy verbose/history forms. |
| `update_goal` | Run outcomes: `complete` (audited from actual evidence; optional `completion_summary` is an untrusted claim), `blocked` (after three consecutive identical blockers), or `paused` (immediate agent pause with required `reason`). |
| `set_goal_tasks` | Create or structurally replace the task tree (flat parent-linked input, confirmation dialog, id-stable merge). |
| `update_goal_task` | Update one task or an ordered atomic batch: start, complete (evidence for contracted tasks), skipped (reason), pending (reopens skipped). |
| `goal_question` | Drafting-only structured clarification question. |
| `goal_questionnaire` | Drafting-only multi-question clarification UI. |
| `propose_goal_draft` | Drafting-only objective/task proposal with Confirm or Continue Chatting. |

Outside drafting, creation and inspection are always advertised. Outcomes are
advertised for active/paused/budget-limited goals; task planning for active or
paused goals; task progress for active goals with tasks. Disabled tasks hide both
task tools. A guided draft replaces goal tools with question/questionnaire/proposal
tools until confirmation or cancellation. Ordinary pi work tools remain available.
The SDK active profile changes only when membership changes. Executors still
validate lifecycle state, including stale calls made after a transition.

Normal prompt/dashboard reads use per-goal ledger indexes: 12 recent events,
64 activity candidates in stable timestamp order, pinned audit/lifecycle state,
and blocker-fingerprint Oracle state. Appends extend these indexes without
copying history. Version 3 derived checkpoints use UTF-8 byte offsets and retain
reconstructed Oracle advice; old or
corrupt checkpoints rebuild from the authoritative JSONL ledger. Full history
is loaded for explicit history/diagnostic requests. Saved goal/session formats
remain compatible. Task presentation caches use content snapshots; usage changes
do not rebuild task trees. Stable prompt rules precede changing goal data and
usage counters, with retrieval instructions beside bounded excerpts.

Warm settings resolution is cached by layer identity and applicable environment
values; public resolved values remain independently editable. Task and prompt
caches compare content fields without repeatedly serializing long contracts.
Compiled detail pages reuse their source and cursor hash; history sources are
invalidated by an opaque ledger generation on append or refresh. Cache size
limits bound retained data; larger requirements remain available losslessly.
Pure ANSI text wrapping/truncation is cached by text and layout arguments across
widgets and dialogs. Live auditor previews scan only the report tail, while the
complete final report remains available. Measurements and the module audit are
in `specs/2026-09-07-comprehensive-optimization/`.

The `tool_call` interceptor blocks work tools after a stop tool has fired in
the same turn, and blocks work tools when the checkpoint that triggered the
turn is no longer actionable (stale checkpoint).

## Accounting, runtime, and token budgets

`GoalAccounting` (goal-accounting.ts) charges serialized, idempotent
token/time intervals per turn; a goal never double-charges the same interval.
`GoalRuntime` (goal-runtime.ts) owns continuation scheduling, the stale
checkpoint state, the turn-stop guard, and one-shot steering reminders.

An optional `token_budget` may be set at creation. When accounted usage
reaches the budget, `accountProgress` transitions the goal to the distinct
`budget_limited` status exactly once (status leaves `active`, so accounting
stops and the transition cannot re-fire), emits a `goal_budget_limited` ledger
event, arms the one-time wrap-up steering, and cancels pending continuations.
`budget_limited` never implies completion.

## Completion output

Completion is explicit and checked by an independent auditor agent.
`update_goal(status="complete")` is valid for active and paused goals; paused
goals do not need to be resumed just to record completion when existing
evidence is sufficient. There is no verification-summary parameter — the
auditor derives the requirements from the objective and any verification
contract and inspects the actual workspace.

Before archiving, the tool starts a separate in-memory pi session with a
focused auditor prompt. The auditor receives the objective, executor
completion claim, and goal metadata, can inspect the workspace with `read`,
`grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `bash`, and must end with exactly one marker:

- `<approved/>` allows archiving;
- `<disapproved/>`, no marker, an error, or abort rejects completion and leaves
  the goal open.

The auditor uses the current/default model unless
`.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json` overrides `provider`, `model`, or `thinkingLevel`.
The user can Escape an in-flight audit to choose "complete without audit" or
"continue working". Archival is deferred to `turn_end` so the agent can see the
auditor result before the goal is archived. The global `disabled` setting is
an explicit user-owned switch: completion skips the auditor, records
`audit_skipped`, and proceeds through the normal deferred-completion path.

## Disk format and old-data reads

Active and archived goal files live under `.pi/goals/`. Each file has
extension-owned metadata and a user-editable `# Goal Prompt` section. Before
focused commands, tools, and lifecycle hooks act, the runtime re-reads the
focused active file and reconciles lifecycle state from disk; prompt-body
edits are picked up from `# Goal Prompt`. Path safety checks reject absolute
paths, traversal, NUL bytes, symlinks, and paths outside the goal directories.

Old readers remain for backward-compatible reads of existing data:
`readActiveGoalPool`, `readGoalLedger`, `mergeGoalPromptFromDisk`,
`latestAuditorResultForGoal`, and `normalizeGoalRecord` are all retained and in
use. The ledger is append-only JSONL and is never rewritten in place.

## Tests

Local tests live in `tests/` and run with:

```bash
npm run test:all
npm run check
```

`test:unit`, `test:integration`, and `test:all` automatically discover test
entries and run them in one Node process with small test-only adapters for the
SDK values used by handlers. This avoids loading unrelated model-provider and
TUI media modules. The fast path requires Node 22.15+; `test:serial` remains
the slow, real-SDK, process-isolated
compatibility path. The suites cover: surface baselines (lifecycle-dependent goal tool
profile and fourteen commands), golden file/ledger fixtures, stale-continuation behavior,
GoalService mutation boundary, runtime/accounting, token-budget transitions,
task-tool consolidation, verification contracts, the independent auditor,
compaction recovery, and the bounded steering prompts. The separate
`tests/e2e/run.ts` real-model path is manual and opt-in. In `experiments/`,
C20-C26 are the release set and B1-B2/C1-C19 are migrated compatibility cases.

## Hardening

The 2026-08-04 hardening plan
([`specs/2026-08-04-goal-simplification-hardening`](../specs/2026-08-04-goal-simplification-hardening/TECH.md))
is implemented: paused-status normalization (status authoritative, legacy
`autoContinue: true` records stay paused), disk-fresh task transactions with
structural-field clearing, token-budget integer validation, `task_reopened`
ledger semantics with observable diagnostics, the lifecycle-dependent tool
profile, and the supported integration/experiment coverage described above.
(the interim drafting-surface removal was later reversed by the product
correction in the runtime follow-up, which restores guided drafting as a
first-class workflow; see the follow-up section below.)

The runtime follow-up
([`specs/2026-08-04-goal-runtime-follow-up`](../specs/2026-08-04-goal-runtime-follow-up/TECH.md))
then shipped the remaining work: guided drafting is restored as a
first-class, transient user-invoked workflow (questionnaire, proposal
confirmation, atomic creation, durable draft sessions, `/goal-cancel`,
`/goal-status`, per-draft auditor selection); the settings menu is fully
operable; `/goal-clear` confirms; task confirmation uses neutral labels;
completion commits are failure-checked; and cross-process mutations are
serialized with persisted revisions plus per-goal filesystem locks that
return typed conflicts to stale writers instead of overwriting blindly.

Prompt layout and explicit provider cache handling are documented in [prompt caching](prompt-caching.md). Live goal state is constructed in the context hook; before_agent_start performs lifecycle preflight without modifying the system prompt.
