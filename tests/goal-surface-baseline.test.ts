/**
 * Stage 0 characterization: the exact registered model-tool and slash-command
 * surface of the goal extension as of the codex-inspired-goal-interface
 * baseline (specs/2026-08-03-codex-inspired-goal-interface).
 *
 * This test is the interface contract for the simplification work. It pins:
 *   - the exact tools registered at extension load (registration order);
 *   - the exact slash commands registered at extension load;
 *   - the phase-dependent advertised tool sets from goal-tool-names.ts.
 *
 * Stages 3-6 of TECH.md intentionally change this surface (five tools, ten
 * commands). Each change must update this baseline deliberately.
